# Agents Studies üóùÔ∏è

LLM agents are AI systems that utilize large language models (LLMs) to perform tasks beyond simple text generation, such as problem-solving, content creation, and conversation. They can maintain conversation threads, recall past statements, and adjust responses accordingly. Essentially, they turn passive LLMs into autonomous, goal-oriented entities that can plan, execute actions, and observe results in a loop. 

## Key Features of LLM Agents:
- **Reasoning and Planning:** They can think through problems and create plans to solve them. 
- **Sequential Reasoning:** They can process information in a step-by-step manner, similar to how humans think. 
- **Memory and Context:** They can remember past interactions and use that information to tailor their responses. 
- **Autonomy:** They can operate independently, making decisions and executing actions without constant human input. 
- **Tool Use:** They can interact with external tools and APIs to access information and perform actions. 
- **Looping Process:** They evaluate a task, decide what to do next, execute actions, observe the result, and continue until the goal is achieved.
